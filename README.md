## ⚠️ Who This Is For

This is **NOT** a beginner's guide.

**Prerequisites:**
- Comfortable with Linux command line and filesystem
- Basic programming knowledge (Python/Bash)
- Understanding of networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, ports)
- Knowledge of how web applications work (requests, responses, sessions)
- Familiarity with HTTP methods and status codes

If you're starting from zero, build foundations elsewhere first. This curriculum assumes technical literacy.

## 🎯 What This Is

A **red team focused** learning path covering offensive security from intermediate to advanced exploitation.

**Methodology:** Theory → Practice → Own Lab

Each module includes:
- **Phase 1:** Deep technical theory
- **Phase 2:** Hands-on exploitation practice
- **Phase 3:** Build and break your own vulnerable systems

**Perspective:** Attacker mindset. Understanding exploitation to build better defenses.
